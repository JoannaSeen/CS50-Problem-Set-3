               Pharmacokinetic
            </h1>
            <p>
               Pharmacokinetics is often confused with Pharmacodynamics. So what exactly is the difference between Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic?
            </p>

            <h2>
                Introduction to Pharmacokinetic Concept
            </h2>
            <p>
                Pharmacokinetic is what the body does to the drug, via the different processes (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion).
                Pharmacodynamic involves how the drug interact with the body via receptors in the body.
                Since we have already made a distinct differentiation between these two terms, let us delve deeper to understand some fundamental concepts of Pharmacokinetic when the drug is taken via the different route of adminsitration (oral, IM, IV, etc.)!
                When conducting a pharmacokinetic study, after the drug is administered to the human or animal, samples are collected from these subjects. The samples collected can be classified into two diffferent types, invasive and non-invasive type.
                The invasive type of samples collected include <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=serum+from+whole+blood&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwjImY6Jjs3tAhXLPysKHdaXA5wQ2-cCegQIABAA&oq=serum+from+whole+blood&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzICCAAyBggAEAUQHjIECAAQGDoECCMQJzoECAAQQzoGCAAQCBAeUJUTWM8mYKUoaABwAHgAgAGVBogB1BySAQ0wLjQuMC4yLjEuMi4xmAEAoAEBqgELZ3dzLXdpei1pbWfAAQE&sclient=img&ei=xSnXX4ijJcv_rAHWr47gCQ&bih=676&biw=1269#imgrc=zaCn2i_9AShFrM" class="plasma">plasma</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=whole+blood+vs+serum&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwiezKrWjs3tAhUMf30KHdxmCz8Q2-cCegQIABAA&oq=whole+blood+vs+serum&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQA1D_Tli0VGCYVmgAcAB4AIABywWIAfsJkgEFNS0xLjGYAQCgAQGqAQtnd3Mtd2l6LWltZ8ABAQ&sclient=img&ei=ZyrXX978IYz-9QPcza34Aw&bih=676&biw=1269#imgrc=8JRagtUwmGDmRM" class="serum">serum</a>, blood.
                Whereas the non-invasive type of samples collected include milk, saliva, urine, feces. With the collection of these samples, it enables pharmaceutical scientist to have a better understanding of the drug movement around the body.
                The most common samples collected are usually plasma, blood and urine.

                Plasma-to-blood concentration drug ratio(\(\frac{C}{C_b}\))
            </h2>
            <p>
                This term refers to the ratio between the drug concentration in the plasma and blood. As the drug concentration
                measured in plasma is not the same as drug concentration measured in blood, this ratio comes in handy when
                calculating clearanance of drug using blood clearance. Note: In literature, it can also be expressed as blood
                to concentration drug ratio (\(\frac{C_b}{C}\)) too.

                    Note: IV does not have absorption as drug is injected intravenously direclty into the systemic circulation. Hence, IV route of adminsitration is assumed to have always have a 100% bioavailability.
            <h3>
                Oral Route of Absorption
            </h3>
            <p>
                For most drugs that are taken orally, the main site of absorption is the duodenum of the small intestine. Due to the microvilli of epithelial cells in the small intestine
                this results in a large surface area of an estimate of \(200m^2\), high blood flow supply (\(1L/min\)) to intestine, more permeable membrane in the small intestine this creates a sink condition
                where the drug within the small intestine is being absorbed into the bloodstream which then goes to the liver for first pass then entering the system circulation. Note: In order for drug to be absorbed into the bloodstream, it is also affected by the size and lipophilicity of the drug molecule.
                The rate of drug absorption is affected by rate of gastric emptying and intestinal motility. Gastric emptying can be altered by meal, drugs such as narcotic drugs, anticholingeric. Intestinal motility can be altered when the
                patient has a diarrhea, resulting in a increased motility through the GI tract. By altering the rate of absorption, this can change the Tmax and Cmax in the plasma drug concentration vs time graph. For example, after a meal, the gastric emptying rate is slower, resulting a in a slower
                rate of absorption as food is released more slowly into the small intestine. This causes a longer T max and lower C max, for drugs that are highly soluble and permeable. However, if the drug is not very soluble or permeable, a slower rate of absorption
                will end up allowing more time for the drug to undergo dissolution and permeation, hence having a greater extent of absorption. As extent of absorption can change the C max and AUC, having a greater extent of absorption due to a slower rate of absorption, results in a longer T max but higher Cmax.

                Intramuscular and Subcutanous Route of Absorption
            </h3>
            <p>
                As the capillaries in muscle and subcutanous tissues are more porous due to larger fernestrations as compared to that of the GI tract. The rate of absorption from these sites are independent of the charge, degree of ionisation and molecular size (up to 5000g/mol) of the drug.
