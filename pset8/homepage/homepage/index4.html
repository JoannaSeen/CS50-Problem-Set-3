                Blood enters the kidney through the renal artery at flow rate of 1100mL/min, which then further divides into many branches, known as the afferent arteriole. The afferent arteriole then divides further to give rise to a capillary network known
                as glomerulus, which then reunites to form the efferent arteriole. There is a Bowman's Capsule also known as Glomerular Capsule is a double walled epithelial membrane that surrounds the glomerular capillaries.
                Water and small dissolved substances leaves the capillaries fernestration and goes through the Bowmwn's capsule through a process known as glomerular filtration. After that, water and these dissolved substances passes through the proximal distal tubule, then to the descending loop of
                Henle, through the ascending loop of Henle, to the distal convoluted tubule and finally through the collecting tubule which is then passed out as urine.

                There are a total of three processes, Glomerular filtation (GFR), Tubular reabsorption and Tubular secretion involved in the clearance of the drug via renally.
                Glomerular filtration forces water and unbound dissolved drug substances through the Bowman's capsule into the renal tubule. The drug may undergo tubular secretion, mainly in the
                proximal tubule, where the drug passes from the bloodstream and enters into the renal tubule. The drug may also undergo tubular reabsorption where it moves from the renal tubule back into the
                bloodstream through the numerous capillaries surrounding the renal tubule. According to how the anatomy of the kidney, glomerular filtration occurs first, followed by tubular secretion and tubular reabsorption.

                Tubular secretion is inferred if renal clearance (\(CL_R\)) is greater than filtration clearance (\(CL_f\) = \(f_u \times\) GFR). Note: We cannot however conclude that tubular reabsorption did not occur. We can only conclude that if tubular reabsorption did occur, it will be less than secretion such that the renal clearance will be much greater than filtration clearance.
